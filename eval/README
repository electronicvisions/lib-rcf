===== Evaluation =====

This Project is to evaluate RCF Serialization (as for now - but further evaluation might be added..)

It's wscript if a TOP script not intended to be included elsewhere.
However it includes "../" (aka rcf-lib) and solely depends on that (and c++11).

  $ waf configure --with-sf-ser # --undefine-debug --define-ndebug
  $ waf
  $ cd lib;./createLibrary.sh;cd ..
  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./lib
  $ # and start the test...
  $ ./testSF # standart test packet is 32 Kib but it can be specified: ./testSF [KiB]
  $ ./testSF 1024 # takes about 10 Minutes with --undefine-debug
